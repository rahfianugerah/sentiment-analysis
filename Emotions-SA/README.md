## Background
<p align="justify">
  The rapid growth of text data originating from various social media platforms, discussion forums, product reviews, and customer service in today's digital era provides an 
  excellent opportunity to explore and understand user emotions. In fields such as marketing, customer service, politics, and mental health, sentiment analysis and emotion 
  detection are becoming increasingly important. By understanding the emotions implicit in text, This model can better understand users' feelings and perceptions and make better decisions.

## Project Overview
<p align="justify">
  This project delves into the realm of human emotion through the lens of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
  The goal is to construct a powerful model that can classify emotions within textual data, effectively creating an "emotional intelligence engine." 
  This model will leverage the capabilities of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning and machine learning framework, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, 
  known for their prowess in handling sequential data like text.
