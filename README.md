## Project Overview
<p align="justify">
  This project delves into the realm of human emotion through the lens of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
  my goal is to construct a powerful model that can classify emotions within textual data, effectively creating an "emotional intelligence engine." 
  This model will leverage the capabilities of TensorFlow, a popular deep learning and machine learning framework, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, 
  known for their prowess in handling sequential data like text.

## About TensorFlow
<p align="justify">
  TensorFlow, an open-source library by Google, empowers users with a comprehensive platform for numerical computation, machine learning, and particularly deep learning. 
  It offers a robust set of tools for complex mathematical operations and facilitates building intricate deep learning models inspired by the human brain. 
  Notably, TensorFlow embraces flexibility by supporting various programming languages and extends its reach beyond model creation 
  by providing deployment tools for real-world applications on servers, mobile devices, and even web browsers. <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow">Click here!</a>
